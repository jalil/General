README for the blenz3/General Git Repository:

The General Git Repository is intended for use as a personal archive and evaluative tool. 

It contains:
 1.) Algorithm Implementations:
   -This directory contains the implementations of various algorithms for to be stored for
    future or current use in personal projects or for use by other programmers in need of a 
    quick implementation.
 2.) API Implementations
   -The API implementations archive contains completed or in-progress API implementations for
    use with personal projects.
 3.) Projects Archive:
   -The projects archive contains the completed or in-progress large scale personal projects.
 4.) Solutions Archive:
   -The solutions archive contains solutions to many different short programming problems that 
    were completed in several different programming languages.

For other programmers looking for a short solution, API implementation, part of an extant project, 
or algorithm implementation, you may use the code as needed. Please note that all of this code is 
freely available as defined by the GNU General Public License (version 3). I would, however, be
appreciative if one would note that the GPL (version 3) license arbitrates that the original author
should still be credited.

For those looking to evaluate my extant work, all of the code in this repository is open to your 
scrutiny. Please note that those projects labelled as 'unfinished' are exactly as listed and 
will not be absolutely representative of the quality of my other finished works
