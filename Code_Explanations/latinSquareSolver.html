<h2>Daily Program for 5/22/2013:</h2>
Hello again, today we will be implementing a program that will solve Latin Squares! If you are not familiar with Latin or are just now hearing about it for the first time, then a Latin Square is simply a 9x9 grid where you have the numbers in the range (1..9) and want to make rows and columns using all of the 9 numbers such that no row or column has two of the same number. If that doesn't immediately make sense to you, then I suggest that you read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_square" target="_blank">the Wikipedia page on Latin Squares</a>. Not only will you gain a better appreciation of combinatorics, but also learn some cool trivia which will benefit you if you ever find yourself on Jeopardy.
<h3>Problem Statement for the Latin Square Solver</h3>
Take a the number of values that the user would like to add to the Latin square as input and insert the values at the specified locations. After initializing the Latin square, show the user the unsolved square and then solve the square and once again show it to the user.

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
Our Latin Square solving program is the largest daily program I have written so far, so let's break it down into chunks that are much easier to understand. In order to solve Latin Square puzzles, I decided to partition my solution into a class and two functions.

In the <em>LatinSquare</em> class we define a single property which is a vector of vectors of integers which will represent our puzzle square and also define 10 methods which are:
<ol>
	<li>The class constructor</li>
	<li>The class destructor</li>
	<li>The <em>printPuzzle</em> method</li>
	<li>The <em>getPosition </em>method</li>
	<li>The <em>setPosition </em>method</li>
	<li><em></em>The <em>checkPosValidity</em> method</li>
	<li>The <em>checkCol </em>method</li>
	<li>The <em>checkRow</em> method</li>
	<li>The <em>getNextPos</em> method</li>
	<li><em></em>The <em>solve </em>method</li>
</ol>
In our class constructor, we take a vector of vectors of integers as input and set it equal to our <em>square</em> property which holds our representation of the puzzle grid. Since we are taking the grid as input, we do not need to worry about initializing the data structure.

Our class destructor is defined, but really does nothing. Since we are only using memory from the stack and do not touch the heap, there are no places in memory to release. Even if you are not explicitly releasing memory from the heap, it is still a good idea to define a class destructor!

The <em>getPosition</em> method takes an integer representing the row value and an integer representing the columnar value as input and returns the value at that location in the <em>square</em> property. We surround this in a control flow statement to make sure that the user doesn't attempt to access any memory that is out of bounds and cause a segmentation fault. Essentially, we are just looking up the value at a certain grid location and are returning it to the user.

In the <em>setPosition</em> method we take three integers as input where the first two specify the row and column location of the cell we are setting and the third value is the value we would like to set the cell equal to. Essentially, we are just setting a cell location to a given input. Note that I didn't include a control-flow statement here to protect against erroneous inputs. If you're implementing this on your own then I suggest that you do!

In order to check whether a piece we have put down is in a legal location we define the <em>checkCol </em>and <em>checkRow</em> methods. Their operations are essentially the same save for whether they iterate through a row or column. In these methods we take two integer as input which represent either the column or row value and the value we want to place. We then iterate through that row or column and count up the number of occurrences of the value we are searching for. Finally we return a result of the comparative expression <strong>(count == 1)</strong> which will yield a value of <strong>false</strong> if there are more than one of the search values meaning that we have performed an illegal move.

The <em>checkPosValidity</em> takes an integer for the row value and an integer for the columnar value as input and provides a simple API for the <em>checkRow </em>and <em>checkCol</em> methods by simply calling both of the methods and returning the result of a logical AND on both of their outputs. This serves to return a boolean representing whether the value in the current position is legal.

Our <em>getNextPos</em> method takes a row and column integer value as input and returns a pair of integers representing the next pair of coordinates. Essentially we simply take the current coordinates for our position in the Latin square as input and return the next pair of coordinates to be evaluated. We do this by controlling for the boundaries of the square and adding to the row coordinate only when the column coordinate is already 8. This method isn't too hard to understand, so I'm sure you'll be able to take it from there.

The <em>solve</em> method is where the magic happens and is just a recursive back-tracking algorithm that builds on the previous cells to solve for the entire grid. Our <em>solve</em> method takes a row and column integer coordinate as input and returns a boolean which represents whether the method is done or not so that it can fully back-track out of the square. I have defined a control-flow statement to check whether the current position is already occupied or not. If the current cell is occupied then we take it for granted that it works and move on to the next position by calling <em>solve</em> again with the coordinates given to us by the <em>getNextPos</em> method. We do this because we want the user to be able to input values into our square as would occur in a real Latin Square puzzle. These values are placed such that they will not make the puzzle unsolvable, which means that they are legal positions that we can take for granted. If there is not already a numeric value in our cell (i.e. other than zero) then we enter a for-loop which iterates through the range of possible numeric values (i.e. 1 through 9) and sets the current position to each one and checks to see if it is a legal move. If the move is legal then we recursively call <em>solve</em> with the next position. If there are no solutions stemming from any of the possible numeric inputs at this position then there must have been an error earlier in our attempt to solve the puzzle so we clear the current cell and exit our current sub-instance of the <em>solve </em>method. This may confuse you, so write it out on paper and play with the code!

Our two functions that we defined outside of th<em></em>e <em>LatinSquare </em>class are the <em>initSquare</em> and <em>main</em> functions. The <em>initSquare </em>function simply initializes a vector of vectors full of 9 zeroes in each sub-vector. It then returns the data structure that it has initialized. The <em>main</em> function handles input and output operations of which all should be familiar so I will not explore this function in depth. If you are implementing this program alongside my code then you may want to note that it would be good to have some error handling in the <em>main</em> function to control for user inputs that are outside of the bounds of the <em>square</em> property in the <em>LatinSquare </em>class.

I hope you enjoyed today's program and feel free to ask me any questions as I know that back-tracking algorithms may be more than a little confusing!
